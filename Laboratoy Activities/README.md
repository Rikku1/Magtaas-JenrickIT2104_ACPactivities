## Lab 1: 🎵Song and 🔤Character Details

### Purpose
📚 To practice user input handling, string operations, and basic comparisons in Python. This lab introduces students to structured data representation and ASCII value comparisons.

### Items

#### Item 1 Song Details 🎶
**Code Summary:**
In this program, users are prompted to input details about a song, such as the year, genre, album, song title, and artist. The details are then neatly displayed in a structured format.

**Instructions for Viewers**
1. ▶️ Run the code and input valid song details as prompted.
2. ✅ Ensure that the output matches the format described.
3. 🔍 Verify that the input data is correctly displayed and formatted.

---

#### Item 2 Character Comparison 🔤
**Code Summary:**
This program takes two characters as input from the user, compares their ASCII values, and displays the character with the greater value. Additionally, it shows the ASCII values of both characters.

**Instructions for Viewers**
1. 🖋️ Provide two characters separated by a space when prompted.
2. ✅ Confirm that the character with the higher ASCII value is correctly identified.
3. 🔍 Check the displayed ASCII values for accuracy.

## Lab 2: 🔢Palindromes and 󠀥󠀥🈹Discounts

### Purpose
🎯 To strengthen skills in logical conditions, string manipulations, and iterative constructs.

### Items

#### Item 1: Palindrome Check 🔄
**Code Summary:**
This program checks if a given integer is a palindrome. It does so by reversing the string representation of the number and comparing it to the original.

**Instructions for Viewers:**
1. 🖋️ Enter an integer when prompted.
2. ✅ Verify that the program correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes.
3. 🔍 Test edge cases, such as single-digit numbers.

---

#### Item 2: Discount Calculator 💸
**Code Summary**
This program calculates a discount based on the purchase amount. For amounts less than 5000, a 5% discount is applied; for 5000 and above, a 10% discount is applied. Users can repeat the process multiple times.

**Instructions for Viewers**
1. 🖋️ Enter purchase amounts and verify the calculated discounts and final prices.
2. ✅ Confirm that the program handles repeated inputs accurately.
3. 🔍 Test boundary cases, such as amounts exactly at 5000.

---

## Lab 3: 🏛️Roman Numerals and 🧮Perfect Numbers

### Purpose
📚 To explore algorithmic thinking through conversions and number theory.

### Items

#### Item 1: Roman Numeral to Integer Converter 🇮🔢
**Code Summary:**
This program converts a Roman numeral entered by the user into its corresponding integer value. It uses a dictionary for mappings and accounts for subtraction cases in Roman numeral rules.

**Instructions for Viewers:**
1. 🖋️ Input valid Roman numerals.
2. ✅ Confirm that the integer values are calculated correctly.
3. 🔍 Test edge cases, such as small and large Roman numerals.

---

#### Item 2: Perfect Number Checker ✔️
**Code Summary:**
This program determines whether a given number is a perfect number. It calculates the sum of all divisors of the number (excluding the number itself) and checks if the sum equals the original number.

**Instructions for Viewers:**
1. 🖋️ Enter numbers to check for perfection.
2. ✅ Verify that the program correctly identifies perfect and non-perfect numbers.
3. 🔍 Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.

---

## Lab 4: 🛠️Object-Oriented Programming and 💾Arrays

### Purpose
🎯 To develop skills in object-oriented programming, class manipulation, and array handling with error management.

### Items

#### Item 1: Capybara Class and Test Cases 🐾
**Code Summary:**
This activity involves creating a `Capybara` class with attributes for name, gender, and age. A separate script allows users to test the class by creating `Capybara` objects and displaying their details based on predefined test cases.

**Instructions for Viewers:**
1. 🖋️ Run the `script.py` file and input valid test case numbers.
2. ✅ Verify that the program correctly creates `Capybara` objects and displays their attributes.
3. 🔍 Check for proper handling of invalid test case inputs.

---

#### Item 2: Array Element Access 🔢
**Code Summary:**
This program prompts the user to define the size of an array and input its elements. It then allows the user to access and print an element at a specified index, handling potential errors like invalid indices or negative sizes.

**Instructions for Viewers:**
1. 🖋️ Input a valid array size and elements as prompted.
2. ✅ Verify that the program retrieves and prints the correct element for a valid index.
3. 🔍 Ensure the program gracefully handles invalid inputs and indices.
